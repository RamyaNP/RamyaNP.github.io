Hi! I am Ramya NP, an undergrad in Computer Science. If you are reading this, you must have stumbled across my tiny cabbage patch of thoughts. Logolepsy, the title of this blog, means an obsession with words. I love words. And this is my attempt at a tribute to words and the power they hold.
I could describe myself here, but I rather let my blog do that for me. L'Chaim!
